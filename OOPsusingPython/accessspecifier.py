'''Python primarily uses three types of access specifiers:

Public:
Public attributes and methods can be accessed from anywhere,
 both inside and outside the class.
 By default, all class members (attributes and methods) are public .
Protected:

Protected attributes and methods are intended to be accessible only within the class and its subclasses (derived classes).
indicated by single underscore as prefix before attributes and methods.
_age
Private :
Private attributes and methods are intended to be accessible only within the class in which they are defined.
In Python, private members are indicated by a double underscore prefix (__).
