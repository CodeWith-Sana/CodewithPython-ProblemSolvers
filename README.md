# Python Problem Solvers

This repository contains solutions to various coding problems solved using Python. It covers basic, intermediate, and advanced-level problems, serving as a learning and practice resource for Python developers.

## Introduction

Welcome to Python Problem Solvers! This repository contains Python problem solutions. Each problem includes well-commented code with an explanation of the logic used. The goal is to improve Python programming skills by solving various coding challenges.

: usage in python
: is used in various contexts, but in the context of slicing sequences (like lists, tuples, and strings),
Slicing Syntax
The general syntax for slicing is:
sequence[start:stop:step] 
sequence: This could be a string, list, tuple, etc.
start: The index where the slice begins (inclusive).
stop: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).
step: (optional) This is the jump between each index in the slice.
Basic Slicing (start:stop)
When you use a colon : between two numbers, it specifies a range of indices:

python
s = "hello"  
print(s[1:4])  # Output: "ell"  

Slicing with Start Only (:stop)
If you omit the start, it defaults to the beginning of the sequence:

python
s = "hello"  
print(s[:3])  # Output: "hel"  
Here, it starts from the beginning and goes up to (but not including) index 3.

Slicing with Stop Only (start:)
If you omit the stop, it defaults to the end of the sequence:

python
s = "hello"  
print(s[2:])  # Output: "llo"  
This starts at index 2 and goes to the end of the string.

When you use a colons in tandem with a negative index, it works similarly but counts backwards from the end of the sequence.
s[:-1]
Meaning: This slice takes all elements of the sequence s except for the last one.
Explanation:
The -1 index refers to the last element of the sequence. The slice stops right before this index when negative slicing is applied.
Example:
python
s = "hello"  
result = s[:-1]  
output: hell
s[:-2]
Meaning: This slice takes all elements of the sequence s except for the last two.

Characters : h e  l  l  o
             0 1  2  3  4
            -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 

comments : 
# single line commment
'''multi line comment'''
Here, 'single iline comment' is a string literal, not a comment. It is valid Python syntax but serves a different purpose. The string would be ignored if it is not assigned to a variable, but it is not considered a comment.
## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x must be installed on your machine.

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sana-Salam/CodewithPython-ProblemSolvers
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your CodewithPytHon-ProblemSolvers
    ```

3. Choose a Python file corresponding to the problem you want to run:
    ```bash
    python problem_name.py
    ```

4. You can run and test the solution with your input.
