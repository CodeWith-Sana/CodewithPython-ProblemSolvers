Hey there!

I'm creating this repository for a Python course that covers all concepts from basic to advanced. It includes:

- Arithmetic operations
- How to find the area of a triangle using Python
- Different operators
- Swapping two variables with or without a temporary variable
- Units conversion
- Random number generation
and much more...

I hope you will find this repository helpful.
